donut is a zero setup required SRT+MPEG-TS -> WebRTC Bridge powered by [Pion](http://pion.ly/).

### Install & Run Locally

Make sure you have the `libsrt` installed in your system. If not, follow their [build instructions](https://github.com/Haivision/srt#build-instructions). 
Once you finish installing it, execute:

```
$ go install github.com/flavioribeiro/donut@latest
```
Once installed, execute `donut`. This will be in your `$GOPATH/bin`. The default will be `~/go/bin/donut`


### Install & Run using Docker

Alternatively, you can build a docker image. Docker will take care of downloading the dependencies (including the libsrt) and compiling donut for you.

```
$ docker build -t donut .
$ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 donut
```

### Open the Web UI
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You will see three text boxes. Fill in your details for your SRT listener configuration and hit connect.

### Run using docker-compose

Docker-compose can simulate an SRT live transmission and run the donut in separate containers.

```
$ make run
```

#### Open the Web UI
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You will see three text boxes. Fill in with the SRT listener configuration and hit connect.
